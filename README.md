# Video-Game-Sales-Analysis 
For my final project, I wanted to learn more about the best-selling video games of all time and if I could find any patterns from the data. 
Specifically, the features that I focused on analyzing were genre, rating, and if a multiplayer mode was included to see if they could lead to higher or lower sales.
Additionally, I also looked at the highest-selling video games by different regions such as North America, Europe, and Japan to find if certain types of games are more popular in certain parts of the world.
